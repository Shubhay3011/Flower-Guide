<p>Lilies are tall perennials ranging in height from 2–6 ft (60–180 cm). They form naked or tunicless scaly
underground bulbs which are their organs of perennation. In some North American species the base of the
bulb develops into rhizomes, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop stolons.
Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground, but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species
form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem
puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal
roots that develop at the base of the bulb, a number of species also produce contractile roots that move the
bulbs deeper into the soil.
