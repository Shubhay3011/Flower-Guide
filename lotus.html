<h1>Lotus</h1>
<img src="lotus.jfif" height="300" width="320">
<p>Lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas.
Stands of lotus drop hundreds of thousands of seeds every year to the bottom of the pond.
While some sprout immediately, and most are eaten by wildlife, the remaining seeds can
remain dormant for an extensive period of time as the pond silts in and dries out. During
flood conditions, sediments containing these seeds are broken open, and the dormant seeds
rehydrate and begin a new lotus colony.
